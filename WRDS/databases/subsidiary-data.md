# Subsidiary Data

## Overview

The WRDS Subsidiary dataset provides **parent–subsidiary ownership relationships** for publicly traded US companies, derived from SEC Exhibit 21 filings.

**What you can find here:**

- **Subsidiary names**: names of subsidiaries owned by public companies
- **Parent companies**: the publicly traded parent (linked by CIK/GVKEY)
- **Jurisdiction**: state or country of incorporation of each subsidiary
- **Ownership structure**: which entities own which subsidiaries

This data is useful for research on corporate structure, multinational operations, tax planning, and geographic footprint analysis.
