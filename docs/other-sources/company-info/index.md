## Industry Classification

### Hoberg & Phillips — Text-Based Network Industry Classifications (TNIC)

<a href="https://hobergphillips.tuck.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Hoberg & Phillips</a> <span class="badge badge-csv">CSV</span> <span class="badge badge-us">US</span> — Text-Based Network Industry Classifications (TNIC) and product market similarity scores derived from 10-K product description text. Covers U.S. public firms. Widely used as an alternative to SIC and NAICS codes for measuring industry competition, product differentiation, and peer firm identification. (<a href="https://hobergphillips.tuck.dartmouth.edu/industrydat.htm" target="_blank">Data download</a>)

The TNIC approach classifies firms into industries based on the similarity of their product descriptions in annual 10-K filings, rather than using fixed codes assigned by regulatory agencies. This allows industries to evolve over time as firm product portfolios change, and captures competitive relationships that SIC/NAICS codes miss.
