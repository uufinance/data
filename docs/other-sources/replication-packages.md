# Journal Replication Packages

Many top finance journals now require authors to deposit replication code and data in a public repository as a condition of publication. The [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) hosts official journal collections for several leading finance journals. All datasets are freely accessible — no registration required to download.
